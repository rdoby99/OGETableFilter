# OGE Table Filter

This repo consists of a custom table filter created by me for the OGE StudyAway website. It takes the table generated in the TerraDotta WYSIWYG and adds filtering functionality along with stylistic changes.

This table was created in an effort to make searching for study away scholarships easier for UGA students.

The table parses tags added to the final column of each row (which is hidden) then selectors use those tags to hide or show table rows.
